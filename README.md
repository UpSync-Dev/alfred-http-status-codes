| [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) | None of this cool stuff would be possible without their launcher |  
| [HTTP Statuses](https://httpstatuses.com/)  | The info content is provided by the website and they've done an aweome job creating it  |
| [goronfreeman](https://github.com/goronfreeman)  | This workflow is based upon his earlier XML one. Alfred used to only support XML but has since added support for JSON, etc. now. His work inspired me to create this one. |
